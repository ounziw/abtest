A/B Test application for Novius OS
===================================

An application for Novius OS.

This application picks a picture from the two pictures randomly, and counts clicks of each picture.
If one picture is clicked more often than the other, it means this picture is better.


Usage
=====
Put this application into your Novius OS's local/application folder.
Log into Novius OS, and activate this application.


Change Log
==========
master branch requires session for identifying users.
In version 0.2, I'm planning to add an option to use $_POST instead of session.
Since ver0.2 is under development, I recommend to use master branch.


License
=======
AGPL ver.3.0 or later
